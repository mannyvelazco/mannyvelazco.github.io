	    Journeys to Work - Commuter Flow Analysis

	    <p class="small abstract">

	      <strong> Abstract. </strong> To better understand 
	      commute flows and the relationship between jobs and
	      housing, I created a series of maps to illustrate both
	      patterns of commutes from Tier 1 Employment Centers and
	      the polycentric movement of residents throughout California.
	      The map illustrates where most San Franciscans travel
	      from work using an algorithm capturing Journey to Work data
	      (Tract-to-Tract) from the US Census database. Weight was added
	      by the numbers and animation was created.

	  </a>
	  (with Eric Kramon and Amanda Lea Robinson). <em> Comparative Political Studies </em> 2017.
	</p>

	    <p class="small abstract">

	      <strong> Abstract. </strong> This article demonstrates
	      that ethnic segregation is a key determinant of public
	      goods provision. We argue that this results from
	      politicians' strategic engagement in ethnic favoritism:
	      only when ethnic groups are sufficiently segregated can
	      elites efficiently target their coethnics with local
	      public goods. We test this expectation with fine-grained
	      data from Malawi on the spatial distribution of ethnic
	      groups, geolocated distributive goods (public and
	      private), and the ethnic identities of political
	      elites. We find that members of parliament provide more
	      local public goods to their constituencies when ethnic
	      groups are geographically segregated, but that this
	      increased investment is primarily targeted toward
	      coethnics. Thus, while segregation promotes overall
	      public goods provision, it also leads to greater
	      favoritism in the distribution of these goods. Our logic
	      and evidence provide an elite-driven explanation for the
	      considerable variation in ethnic favoritism and the
	      under-provision of public goods in ethnically diverse
	      settings.

            Do Elections Improve Constituency Responsiveness? Evidence from U.S. Cities </a>
	  (with Darin Christensen). </p>

	    <p class="small abstract">

	      <strong> Abstract. </strong>

              Do elections motivate incumbent politicians to serve their voters?
              In this paper we use millions of service requests placed by
              residents in U.S.\ cities to measure constituency
              responsiveness. We then test whether an unusual policy change in
              New York City, which enabled city councilors to run for three
              rather than two terms in office, improved constituency
              responsiveness in previously term-limited councilors'
              districts. Using difference-in-differences, we find robust
              evidence for this. Taking advantage of differential timing of
              local election races in New York City and San Francisco, we also
              find late-term improvements to responsiveness in districts
              represented by reelection seeking incumbents. Elections improve
              municipal services, but also create cycles in constituency
              responsiveness. These findings have implications for theories of
              representative democracy.

            Pulling back the Curtain: Intra-district School Spending Inequality and its Correlates
            </a>
	  (with Kenneth Shores). </p>

	    <p class="small abstract">

	      <strong> Abstract. </strong>

              Despite concerns about funding inequities between schools within
              districts, data constraints have limited large-scale analyses of
              intra-district inequality in the United States. We use new
              school-level finance data to calculate measures of vertical
              inequality for nearly all U.S. districts. Using independent
              high-quality data sources, we validate the school-level data and
              the resulting inequality measures. With a valid analytic sample at
              hand, we find that poor and minority students on average receive 1
              to 2 percent more resources than non-poor and white students in
              the same district, but also that a large share of districts
              under-allocate resources to disadvantaged students. We also
              examine correlates of inequality. Districts that under-allocate
              resources to poor students relative to non-poor students tend to
              be poorer and have less income segregation. Districts that
              under-allocate resources to minority students relative to white
              students tend to have smaller racial income gaps, less racial
              segregation, and (when it comes to under-allocation to black
              students) larger white student populations.
